The data undergoes preprocessing through a pipeline that utilizes TF-IDF vectorization, followed by classification using the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. Achieving an accuracy of 78.83%, we've successfully trained the model. Additionally, we've developed a user-friendly Streamlit web app for predicting sentiments in unknown test data, enhancing accessibility and usability.")
